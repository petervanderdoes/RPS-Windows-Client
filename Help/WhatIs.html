<h3>What is the RPS Digital Viewer? </h3>
<p>The Raritan Photographic Society (RPS) has introduced competitions for dgital images.  The digital images are stored on a laptop and projected onto a screen with an LCD projector for judging. Initially, PowerPoint was used as the software to project the images. While PowerPoint does a fine job of projecting the images, it doesn't offer any way to record the image scores during judging.  Nor does it offer any way to easily select the highest scored images for assigning awards.</p>

<p>The RPS Digital Viewer was created to overcome some of the shortcomings of PowerPoint for RPS digital competitions. The primary objectives were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Display .jpg images at a resolution of 1024x768 with no cropping, scaling or obscuring of the images</li>
  <li>Record the score for each image in real time during judging</li>
  <li>Select subsets of the images, by score, and reproject them for further judging to assign awards</li>
</ul>
<p>The RPS Divital Viewer has also been designed to streamline the workflow of the RPS digital competitions as much as possible. The general workflow for these competions is: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Prior to the competion, members email their images to an email address on the club web site</li>
  <li>The digital competition chairperson downloads the images from the web site to a laptop  and organizes them by member classification (Beginner, Advanced, Salon)</li>
  <li>On the night of the competition, the images are projected and judged one classification at a time  </li>
  <li>The judge's score for each image is recorded</li>
  <li>After a classification has been scored the number of awards is calculated</li>
  <li>Only images receiving a score of 7 or more are eligible for awards</li>
  <li>Images that scored 7 are selected and reprojected. The judge will choose which images in the group will receive the available awards.</li>
  <li>This process is then repeated for images that received a score of 8 and then again for images with a score of 9 until all awards have been assigned</li>
  <li>Finally, images that received an award, <u>and</u> any images that scored 8 or better but without an award, are selected and projected so the maker of each image can be announced</li>
  <li>The judging process is then repeated for the next classification</li>
  <li>After the competition, the digital competition chairperson sends a listing of all the scores for all the images to the club web master  to update the web site </li>
</ul>
