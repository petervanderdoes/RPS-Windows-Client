<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Since you're reading this,  the installation instructions are really moot. Never the less, let me run through the details again in case you need to reinstall.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Extract the contents of the RPS Digital View.zip file  into a folder on a Windows drive</li>
  <li>That's all there is to it.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Initial Assumptions</h3>
<p>The executable program makes certain assumptions when it is first installed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The executable expects the database file (rps.mdb) to be in the same folder as the executable itself.</li>
  <li>The images are expected to      be stored in subfolders within the installation folder. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these assumptions can be overridden with the <strong>File &gt; Preferences</strong>... dialog. </p>
<h3>Uninstall</h3>
<p>Delete the executable (.exe) file and the database file (*.mdb) </p>
</body>
