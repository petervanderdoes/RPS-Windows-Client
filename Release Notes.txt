Release Notes
=============

Changes made between version 1.4.1 (17-Oct-2010) and version 1.4.2 (12-Feb-2011)

1.  When any of the image selection comboboxes; Comp Date, Theme, Classification, Medium, Award was 
    changed they were not setting the AllScoresSelected flag back to true.  This caused the statusbar 
    text in the slideshow to show the photographer's name at the beginning of a new competition.
    Take 2:  Apparantly I didn't fix this in v1.4.1 like the v1.4.1 release notes say. :-(

Known Problems
--------------
- When executable is run off a thumb drive and the Images Root Folder had previously been set in the registry to C:\RPS, the path stored in the database was incorrect (F:\\hotos\....)
